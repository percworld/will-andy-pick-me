### What iteration did you complete?
 Iteration 1 though It is a mix of both iterations, as I got sidetracked into working on iteration 2 requirements. I don't believe that I set the innerText of the input to clear until after my push at noon, which was required for iteration 1.  I felt that ten more minutes would have yeilded much better results for my documentation!
 
### How far into the iteration you were in progress on were you? Be specific.

I ran out of time as I was checking into the requirements but again, did not start working on error handling and field clearing yet.  I spent a large portion of this time on the comp itself and am still very slow in regards to getting a comp matched out well.

### What was most challenging about this for you?

I had to look up some things in regards to the css styling and got stuck with fitting the image to it's container. Initially I forgot a closing secion tag in html and it took me some time to figure out my mistake.
